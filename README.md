# GeckoTerminal Integration for Home Assistant

Monitor token pool prices from [GeckoTerminal](https://www.geckoterminal.com) directly in Home Assistant!  
This custom integration fetches real-time data from the GeckoTerminal DEX API and creates sensors for your selected liquidity pools.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Create sensors for token pools by entering:
  - Sensor name
  - Network (e.g. `base`, `ethereum`, `arbitrum`)
  - Liquidity pool address
- Real-time token price in USD
- Configuration via Home Assistant UI (Config Flow)
- Editable options (network/pool address) via UI (Options Flow)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation via HACS

1. Go to **HACS â†’ Integrations â†’ â‹¯ â†’ Custom Repositories**
2. Add this repository URL:
   ```

   with category **Integration**
3. Find **GeckoTerminal** in the list and click **Install**
4. Restart Home Assistant

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Use Case

- Pool address: `0x23a331e9bc1e2c08e44b6ce7f0c35f74b322e6ad`

The integration will create a sensor showing the current base token price in USD.
